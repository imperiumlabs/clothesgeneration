# Clothing Generation Brand Plugin

This plugin is intended to convert manufacturing blueprints of shorts and shirts into virtual 3D models of clothing. These models of clothing can then be browsed via our virtual dressing room application. 

## How to Use

### Modeling

Modeling tools help create basic shapes which can be later stitched into 3D objects. First, import the blueprint of the article of clothing. Using the spline tool, outline the blueprint. Adjust the curves to match the outline. When the outline is done, create the plane.

### Human

When all flat pieces corresponding to the blueprint are modeled, import the human. Arrange the pieces around the human model. 

### Sewing
